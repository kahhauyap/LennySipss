        review: 'Bon Chon drinking a whisky based cocktail to have with my extra hot fried chicken. Bon chon is one of those places you drop by to watch a game with friends. They have multiple big screens on the walls and are usually broadcasting basketball games or music videos. Is anyone excited for the NCAA Men’s Basketball? I was rooting for my college team to win but unfortunately they lost to Texas. Which team are you mad for March Madness?',

        review: 'The Dock is the newest restaurant that opened up in the Bushwick area. It’s the combination of three big cuisines, Japanese/Sushi, Ramen, and Thai all under one roof. Their warm and inviting environment makes it the perfect place to grab a drink in the afternoon, they offer multiple options for beer/wine/sake but I chose to try a chu hai. The Matcha Chu Hai is a carbonated matcha flavored cocktail with hints of lemon flavor. To enjoy this cocktail you’d have to have an acquired taste for matcha because it’s carbonated with hints of fruit hidden behind every sip. As someone who is a big matcha fan I love trying any restaurants matcha cocktail if the option is available.'

        review: 'Chicken wings and alcohol, the two make a perfect combination. I came here with some of my friends to grab a few drinks, it’s a great place to drink beer and soju. This calpisake is a mixture of sake, strawberry purée, and strawberry calpico. The cocktails here are very light and can be enjoyed without worrying too much about work the next day, would recommend light drinkers who want to enjoy the beauty of a cocktail to come and try their menu.'

        review: 'An adventurous cocktail at TEOs is their green tea cocktail. It is mixed with gin, sake, green tea, and tonic. This cocktail is extremely refreshing and pairs well with their seed weed + fungus ramen. My next visit here I will need to try the negroni, the bartender highly recommended it if I was feeling extra adventurous because it has a complex chocolate flavor.'

        review: 'Best way to enjoy your brunch, a juicy burger with a light cocktail. The French 55 has bulldog gin, rose liqueur, sparkling wine, and lemon juice. Brunch isn’t about getting hammered in the morning, it’s about enjoying your day off with a light refreshing cocktail and eating with your friends.'
